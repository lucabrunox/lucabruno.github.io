Hello,  
Google Reader has just wiped out my subscriptions list, which made me scream like a crazy monkey (other than cleaning up the list).Now I'm using bloglines, which looks pretty good except there's nothing like "read all items", but you must clean on each feed to see the items (any alternative to bloglines supporting this?).  
  
But as far as I can see, I'm not [the only one](http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/reader/thread?tid=6c3e329b13c0526d&hl=en) that lost the feeds, the difference is that I just opened the reader without any other operation.  
  
I've also heard of MyYahoo! being a good aggregator, the only problem is that Epiphany/Webkit is broken with yahoo (no css), anybody experiencing this?
