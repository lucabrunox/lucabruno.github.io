Hello,  
I've written a simple program for playing with a [Rubik's Cube](http://www.rubiks.com/) using [Vala](http://live.gnome.org/Vala) and [Clutter](http://www.clutter-project.org/).  
  
It features:  

*   high simplicity in rotating cube slices and rotating the cube itself in a very natural manner
*   shuffle the cube
*   autosave the game
