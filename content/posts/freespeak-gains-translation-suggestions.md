Hello,  
it hasn't been a long time since [FreeSpeak](http://freespeak.berlios.de/) [0.2.0](http://lethalman.blogspot.com/2008/11/freespeak-020-has-been-released.html) has been released. One of the [TODO](http://git.berlios.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=freespeak;a=blob_plain;f=TODO;h=03e80a7cd82ab56d177b25d9d0335717528d93ab;hb=HEAD)s for the next release was to support [open-tran](http://open-tran.eu/), and more over translation suggestions for development.
