Hello,

I'm lately following the Vala development and finally we got a new release with plenty of bug fixes and enhancements which makes Vala even more interesting and usable as general purpose language.

  

Here's the [announcement](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/vala-list/2010-February/msg00040.html).

I'd like to point you to the new [Vala journal](http://valajournal.blogspot.com/), a good resource to stay tuned with Vala changes periodically.

  

News:

\* Support coalescing operator ??.

\* Support to\_string and bitwise complement with enums.

\* Return handler id when connecting signal handlers.

\* Support struct comparison.

\* Support constructor chaining in structs.

\* Enforce protected member restrictions.

\* Improve performance of flow analysis.

\* Support automatic line continuations in Genie.

\* Improvements to the .gir reader and writer.
