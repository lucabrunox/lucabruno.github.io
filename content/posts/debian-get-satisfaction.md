Hello,  
lately I've found [getsatisfaction](http://getsatisfaction.com/), a social web2 free customer support for all companies and products.  
Of course, what have I done is to look for the [Debian company](http://getsatisfaction.com/debian). Well it's there, but unused.  
  

1.  Easy for novice users to ask and find answers there.
2.  You can share you ideas and get help
3.  Report problems and get help on bug reporting
4.  General and specific discussion
5.  Subdivide the service in variuos products (for examples ports and distributions)
