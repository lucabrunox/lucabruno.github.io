Hello,  
I'm writing about the work done in the [bug](http://np237.livejournal.com/27754.html) [triage](http://np237.livejournal.com/27966.html) weekend of the Debian/GNOME team, started at 27th Feb and ended in 28th Feb.  
The result is great, 167 bugs have been closed and many more have been triaged and forwarded upstream.  
  
Thanks to everybody who contributed, especially to whom has done it for the first time (well, you can still continue working on the remaining bugs ;) ).
