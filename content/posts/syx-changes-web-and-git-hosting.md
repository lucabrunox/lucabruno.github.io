Hello,

I'm officializing the change of web hosting and git hosting from googlecode to berlios:

_

  
![](http://syx.berlios.de/images/syx-logo.png)

The new [website](http://syx.berlios.de/) is up!

For [several](http://groups.google.com/group/syx-discuss/t/eac3bb648bec6dfa) [reasons](http://groups.google.com/group/syx-discuss/t/aa7cfd76fbd77e11), including [reliability](http://groups.google.com/group/syx-discuss/browse_thread/thread/ab71093a2f69e1de/c89f23195d40a871?lnk=gst&q=svn#c89f23195d40a871), we switched both the website and git hosting to berlios. Also the purpose of this change is to rewrite the website backend using Syx.

The mailing list and the bug tracker are still hosted at [googlecode](http://syx.googlecode.com/).

  

**Some progress news in the while**

We're working on a new memory management, object representation and garbage collector. On the other side the lack of time is making things harder for releasing the new version. Together with the above changes, new Smalltalk standard pieces will implemented as usual. I remind you the new code is in

the [**object**](http://git.berlios.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=syx;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/object) branch.
