Hello,  
I report the [post on the mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/syx-discuss/browse_thread/thread/d8a77c3c3042087d) below:  
  
Hello,  
with the next release 0.1.7, once I get a working interpreter and updated all the parts of Syx,  
I will move output of doxygen to doc/reference and start a texinfo manual in doc/manual.  

My idea is to have this kind of manual:  
1) What is Smalltalk  
2) Why Smalltalk YX  
3) Introduction to the language  
4) Introduction the Syx environment  
5) COMPLETE Class and methods documentation, EACH non private method will be documented with examples  
and EACH class will have usage examples  
6) Embedding  
7) Advanced topics, internal documentation  

I know it's not the time yet for Smalltalk YX to get such documentation but I think it will be  
a nice boost for the project and also for the entire Smalltalk community.  
Since I don't have such fantasy now I will start directly with all except the 5th topic.  

Any hint will be appreciated.  
Bye.  
  
EDIT:  
The Smalltalk reference will be created automatically from Smalltalk itself.
