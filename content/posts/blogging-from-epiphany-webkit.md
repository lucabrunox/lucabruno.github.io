Hello,  
I've been using Midori for a while. It's a great browser: innovative and light. However all my bookmarks and data are in Epiphany. Last week the new epiphany-webkit version has been uploaded in Debian Sid and I couldn't wait to test it. I'm currently using it instead of gecko; it has still some issues but I begun living without it.
