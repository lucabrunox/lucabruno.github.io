Hello,  
everyone knows that gnomefiles has went offline with that boring redirect to osnews.com.  
Now many people is looking toward [gtk-apps.org](http://gtk-apps.org/), I didn't know it before. It's looking really good.  
The only problems is that I had (and I guess I'm not the only one) a few unmaintained projects on gnomefiles and they are now lost.  
I'm wondering if it will be publicized a day by gtk.org to be something more official.
