Hello,  
together a couple of university mates we talked about a possible free (as in freedom) ArchiCAD alternative. There are several free CAD out there but none is free for architects/engineers. The project is too big and ambitious, but I wanted to give OpenGL a shot with this excuse to learn something new.  
  
I've started two projects:  

*   Corraza, the OpenGL framework for editing 3d objects and exporting the scene graph to ray tracing software... think about a very very very minimal blender but as library

*   Spadi, the GTK+ application that runs on top of Corraza

  
You can find a [video here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3D7CLdhvuk) to see what it can do now, after a week of development.  
There's no code published at the moment, contact me if you would like to join the development.  
  
Stay tuned.
