Hello,  
I was curious to see if aptitude-gtk was making some progress. I haven't followed the project since it's been merged into aptitude.  
Well, I found it more functional and complete. Here's a screenshot showing pending packages for upgrade after an update:

The team is definitely doing a good job. Hopefully I'll find the time to give some help as I'm really interested in such full-featured GUI frontend.  
Keep going on!
