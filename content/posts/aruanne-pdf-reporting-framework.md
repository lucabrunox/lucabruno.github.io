Hello,  
a while ago I've been talking about pango cairo and how to generate pdf with a couple of tables.  
In the meantime I've worked on it, improving and enhancing new kinds of elements. This has lead to the creation of a small project, a library providing a simple framework for generating mostly PDF reports (I haven't tried to generate SVG or something else yet).  
  
After a couple of release requests, I've found finally the time to publish a sort of working code.  
  
Here's the [git repository](http://gitorious.org/aruanne) and [here you can download the snapshot tarball](http://gitorious.org/aruanne/aruanne/archive-tarball/master).  
  
Any patches welcome.
