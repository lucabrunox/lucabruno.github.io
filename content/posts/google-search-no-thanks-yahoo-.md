Hello,

  
lately I've been searching for "maemo emulator" and "mod\_python psp" and the results weren't good to me.

  
If you don't trust, try the above searches (without double quotes) with both Google and Yahoo. This happens with many more searches.

  
In my opinion, Google lately is lacking a good page weight system and therefore it breaks results showing for example mailing lists instead of more important web pages.

  
Conclusion? I'm using Yahoo! as my default search engine until Google fixes these troubles.
