Hello,  
I'd like to point you to this firefox extension [HTTPS Everywhere](http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/06/encrypt-web-https-everywhere-firefox-extension) (June 17th, 2010) and [SSLGuard](http://decrew.indivia.net/sslguard/index.html) which is also a firefox extension (first released Oct 14th, 2009).  
  
The code of the former extension is a lot more complicated and the result is not always quite the same as SSLGuard. In fact, while they support secure cookies and per-website custom rules, SSLGuard lets you add custom websites to be secured directly from a friendly graphical dialog.  
  
You could even install both of them, apparently they don't conflict.  
  
It's the second time [decrew](http://decrew.indivia.net) ideas are being duplicated. This happened sometimes ago with [SSLtoHTML](http://decrew.indivia.net/ssltohtml/index.html) (ettercap plugin) and [sslstrip](http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip) (standalone application), but they released the code before us. Funny isn't it?  
  
I'm not complaining about anything (I'm not saying "copy", I say "duplicate"), just clearing things out. Of course, better have more choice and more works.
