Hello,  
today is the [Debian](http://www.debian.org) birthday. For this event a Debian Appreciation Day has been prepared to thank all the Debian organization, all the contributors, developers, teams and everything related to the universal operating system. If you want to thank Debian and make developers feel loved :P here's the page: [thanks.debian.net](http://thanks.debian.net/).
