Hello,  
it's often useful for [Vala](http://live.gnome.org/Vala) hackers to have a graphical representation of the code tree and control flow blocks. Therefore I've created a simple application called [Valag](http://lethalman.hostei.com/valag.html) which generates four types of diagrams using [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org) for each state of the Vala compiler.  
  
This is the first release, there're many things to fix and enhance (like command line options) but it is working quite good already to give support when hacking Vala.
