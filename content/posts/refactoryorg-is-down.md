Unfortunately many of my snippets in this blog have been written and uploaded exclusively on refactory.org . It was a free service for uploading snippets of any kind, with a friendly versioning system and other cool features.  
It's now inactive since several months. I'm sorry for anybody stumbling upon any post that has code hosted at refactory.org . From now on I will try to put the code in the post itself whenever I can, or find better places to upload the code.
