Hi,  
I've lately held an talk on IRC about the [Vala programming language](http://live.gnome.org/Vala) for the [Ubuntu App Developer Week](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuAppDeveloperWeek). I've introduced the basics of the Vala language and its features.  
You can read the log of the [talk here](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/appdevweek1109/HelloValaIntroduction).
