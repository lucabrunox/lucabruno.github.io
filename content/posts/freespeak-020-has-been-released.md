after some work in these weeks now I have released a new version of [FreeSpeak](http://freespeak.berlios.de/).  
  

> FreeSpeak is a free (as in freedom, developed and released under the terms of GPL) frontend to online translator engines (such as Google, Yahoo, etc.). It is written in Python, it uses the GTK toolkit and some GNOME infrastructure features

It's been rewritten almost from scratch so I think there's no need to post release notes here. Anyway you can always read what changed from the old version released a couple of years ago [here](https://developer.berlios.de/project/shownotes.php?group_id=10396&release_id=15471).  
  
Notice that the project homepage has been changed. The project has now moved to [BerliOS.de](https://developer.berlios.de/projects/freespeak/).
