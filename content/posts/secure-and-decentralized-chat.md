Hello,

I'm writing to let you know of the first release of [SDChat](http://decrew.indivia.net/sdchat/index.html).

It is a protocol with libraries and programs to create secure IM networks using GPG and RSA.

All the stack is written in Python but the page says it will be rewritten from scratch to provide a C API.

  

It features a GTK+ interface with many plugins (unfortunately audio and video are being broken due to gstreamer updates) and a simple server for routing. No installation is required.

  

Wondering if this can be any useful for Iranians.
