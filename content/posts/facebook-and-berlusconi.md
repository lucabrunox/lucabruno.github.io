Hello,  
today many people are getting subscribed (with NO authorization) automatically to this group: Sosteniamo SILVIO BERLUSCONI contro i FAN di massimo tartaglia. You have NO notification that you've been subscribed to this group.  
  
Also consider the geographic position ([screenshot](http://img197.imageshack.us/img197/3143/31590708.png)) of the group contact.  
  
Also consider that the group can't be signaled to facebook, because the feature looks like out of service.  
  
It's clearly a mafia group, beware of!
