Hello,

I've just released the first version of [Maja](http://lethalman.hostei.com/maja/index.html), the [Vala](http://live.gnome.org/Vala) to Javascript compiler. The mapping is not quite complete but you can do pretty much everything you could do with javascript directly. There are (still incomplete) bindings for the [qooxdoo framework](http://qooxdoo.org/) and the [demo browser](http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/demobrowser/) is being ported to vala successfully.

Maja can be used in any environments, not only web browsers.

Programming in Vala saves you from lots of type safety troubles (Javascript), lot of typing (Java) and the syntax is really enjoyable as it is quite close to the Javascript model.

  

Usage and download [at the homepage](http://lethalman.hostei.com/maja/index.html).
