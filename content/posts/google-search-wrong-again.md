Hello,  
sometimes ago I posted twice about google search having wrong results.  
Now it happens again after a few months (it's like google breaks page weights like every 4-5 months).  
The search is "debian dpkg list", I really expect the mailing list info page but after 3-4 pages of google search (and also bing this time) I couldn't find it. With yahoo search it's at the first position (lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg).  
  
Like for the previous posts, using different search engines matters and matches your needs.
