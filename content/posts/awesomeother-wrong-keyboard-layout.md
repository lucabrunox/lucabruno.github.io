Hello,  
due to the high resource usage by Eclipse (I have to use that unfortunately because of my professor) I've temporarly dropped GNOME and now I'm using [Awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org/) for a while.  
  
Ok let's say the problem: the keyboard. Do you have different languages, layouts and so on among several configurations (GNOME, X, ...) and your keyboard layout is messed up with awesome?  
Just do it:  
  

> setxkbmap -layout YOURLAYOUT

  
  
Where YOURLAYOUT for me is it.  
  
I've found this utility in [this mailing thread](http://www.mail-archive.com/awesome-devel@naquadah.org/msg00059.html). Yet you can read that awesome is still too young and lacks some keyboard configuration features.  
  
Have fun!
