So I'd like to share with you my google reader alternative: [theoldreader](http://theoldreader.com/).  
I've tried so far [yoleo](https://yoleoreader.com/), [feedly](http://cloud.feedly.com/), [goread](http://www.goread.io/) and [diggreader](http://digg.com/reader). Each of them is missing the following must have things for me:  

*   The "next" button. I don't like using keyboard bindings when reading feeds.
*   Search through all feeds
*   Social by sharing/liking news
*   Exporting OPML

Additionally, theoldreader has a great (disabled by default) feature: clicking on a news will scroll to it. That is very handy if you don't want to stick your mouse clicking on the next button.  
  
The only bad point of theoldreader is that there's an import queue, I'm currently in position 1566 (1481 after about 15 minutes). Other than that, it's perfect for my needs and resembles most of google reader.  
  
**Update**: the search only looks for terms into post titles, not post contents :-(
