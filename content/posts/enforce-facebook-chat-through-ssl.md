Hello,

since a few days facebook is supporting SSL for the chat. The problem is that it can't be enabled.

Until facebook enables this you can use the [SSLGuard](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/sslguard/) plugin for firefox, which enforces SSL for a list of web sites, including all facebook pages and the chat as well.  

We have some good ideas for sslguard that we'd like to get in for the next releases... stay tuned.
