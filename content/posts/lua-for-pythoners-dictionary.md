Hello,  
as promised this is the [second post](http://lethalman.blogspot.com/2009/12/lua-for-pythoners-lists.html), this time for dictionaries. The most important thing to notice is that tbl\[key\]=nil means deleting the entry from the table, while in python dict\[key\]=None is still a valid entry with None value.  
  
Here's [the snippet](http://www.refactory.org/s/lua_for_pythoners_dictionary/view/1) you can launch in a lua interpreter and this is the [catalog of python dictionary](http://www.java2s.com/Code/Python/Dictionary/CatalogDictionary.htm) examples.
