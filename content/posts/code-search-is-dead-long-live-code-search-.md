I'm bumping a breaking news from debian.net: [Introducing codesearch.debian.net, a regexp code search engine](http://www.debian-news.net/2012/11/06/introducing-codesearch-debian-net-a-regexp-code-search-engine/)  
  
The days of [google codesearch](http://codesearch.google.com/) are ended since a while, but now we have an up-to-date and open source [debian codesearch](http://codesearch.debian.net/).  
  
  
(from the about page):  

> It searches all the open source projects which are included in the Debian archive (the "main" distribution only, not non-free or contrib). Currently, that includes about 18000 packages with 140 GiB of source code.  
> The search engine itself is based on [Russ Cox’ codesearch tools](https://code.google.com/p/codesearch/), meaning it uses Regular Expressions as input. Like the codesearch tools, it was implemented in [Go](http://www.golang.org/).

  
The project is a thesis so the source code won't be available until January 2013, and we all hope that the project continues beyond that date.
