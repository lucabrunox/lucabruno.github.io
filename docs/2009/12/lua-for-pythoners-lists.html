    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Hello,<br>
lately I&rsquo;m discovering <a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a> as general purpose language. Many people don&rsquo;t agree with lua being used as a general purpose language, many others (including a newbie like me) think Lua has such a simple syntax and powerful tables to become a full fledged language.<br>
I use a lot of Python, so I start from here: what Python does that Lua can&rsquo;t do almost in the same way? Read the question as it is, don&rsquo;t read &ldquo;what Python does that Lua can&rsquo;t do&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>This is the first of several post series I&rsquo;m writing. I&rsquo;m trying to &ldquo;translate&rdquo; <a href="http://www.java2s.com/Code/Python/CatalogPython.htm">python pills</a> in Lua + <a href="http://penlight.luaforge.net">Penlight</a></p>
<p>Please consider that many things can be done really better in Lua. As I said, this is a kind of &ldquo;translation&rdquo;. You will understand that Lua does better than Python in other things that will not be shown because the examples are made in Python.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.refactory.org/s/lua_for_pythoners_lists/view/2">Here&rsquo;s the snippet</a>, you can run it with a stand-alone Lua interpreter.</p>
<p>If you know better ways of doing things like in Python please comment. Comments like &lsquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s inefficient! This is not the way you do things in Lua&rsquo; are accepted of course but not related to the post.</p>
<p>Errata:<br>
I&rsquo;ve had some important feedback thanks to #lua people in IRC:<br>
- Variables in Lua are globally assigned, so at least in functions you must use local<br>
- Using table.insert in loops is slow, better use tbl[#tbl+1] assignment, and even better remember the next free position tbl[next] = element; next = next + 1</p>
