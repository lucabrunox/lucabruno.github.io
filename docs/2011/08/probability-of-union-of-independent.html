Unfortunately I couldn&rsquo;t find any algorithm for such a basic problem.<br>
Therefore, I decided to write the following naive algorithm which is fast enough for my purposes (O(n2) in time and space, where n is the number of events), and share with everyone:</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="http://www.refactory.org/s/probability_of_a_union_of_independent_non_mutually_exclusive_events/view/latest">code snippet here</a>, sorry for not embedding it in the blog post but blogger is really boring me with snippets having broken layout.</p>
<p>The idea behind the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">dynamic programming</a> approach starts from this observation:</p>
<p>Let A, B and C be independent non mutually exclusive events. Then:</p>
<p>P(A or B or C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A)P(B) - P(A)P(C) - P(B)P(C) + P(A)P(B)P(C)</p>
<p>Let me simplify the expression using A instead of P(A):</p>
<p>P(A or B or C) = A+B+C - AB - AC - BC + ABC</p>
<p>Notice that AB+AC+BC = A(B+C) + BC. In general:</p>
<p>AB+AC+AD+&hellip;+AZ + BC+BD+&hellip;.+BZ = A(B+C+D+&hellip;+Z) + B(C+D+&hellip;+Z)</p>
<p>ABC+&hellip;+ABZ + ACD+&hellip;+ACZ+&hellip;+AYZ + BCD+&hellip;+BYZ = A(B(C+D+&hellip;+Z)+C(D+&hellip;+Z)+&hellip;+YZ) + B(C(D+&hellip;+Z)+&hellip;+YZ)</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly where we exploit the dynamic programming to avoid recalculating the same expressions twice.</p>
<p>Edit: My effort was totally useless given that for independent events this is equivalent to 1 - (1 - pA)(1 - pB)&hellip;, which can be calculated in linear time. I even used this formula once and forgot about it :-(</p>
