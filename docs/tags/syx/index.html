Hello,
I&rsquo;m officializing the change of web hosting and git hosting from googlecode to berlios:
_
The new website is up!
For several reasons, including reliability, we switched both the website and git hosting to berlios. Also the purpose of this change is to rewrite the website backend using Syx.
The mailing list and the bug tracker are still hosted at googlecode.
Some progress news in the while
We&rsquo;re working on a new memory management, object representation and garbage collector.

      Hello,
in the new branches of Syx (an open source Smalltalk-80 implementation) we&rsquo;re working to try a new kind of memory management and add many features that have been missed until now to focus on other stuff.
The new faster and more modern v0.1.8 release will contain the following refactoring:
Objects will be variable-length (minumum 12 bytes on 32-bit processors and 16 bytes on 64-bit processors)
By changing the objects also the GC changed to a mark and compact GC

after several months a new version of Syx has been released. This release contains mostly VM changes and some changes to the Smalltalk Collections. As usual, release notes follow:
This versions enhances a new version of the interpreter, major updates to the scheduler, and as usual a lot of bug fixes. Syx left the Google Code SVN repositories because of many connection problems.
You can find informations about the new GIT repository here: http://code.

      Hello,
you all know that Gtk+ has locks for the GUI when dealing with the X server and prevent async events to be sent. This is done by manually acquiring/releasing the lock on Gdk. Many Gtk+ ports don&rsquo;t do this automatically.
Syx used gtk_main() into a thread and automatically put gdk enter/leave for each function in its wrapper. It would be somewhat ugly in Smalltalk code having to enter/leave each time.

Hello,
with the next release 0.1.7, once I get a working interpreter and updated all the parts of Syx,
I will move output of doxygen to doc/reference and start a texinfo manual in doc/manual.
My idea is to have this kind of manual:
What is Smalltalk Why Smalltalk YX Introduction to the language Introduction the Syx environment COMPLETE Class and methods documentation, EACH non private method will be documented with examples

      Hello,
Smalltalk YX is currently working on refactoring a part of the interpreter, relative to contexts and stack management.
The current version uses one stack per process but always create contexts for each method or block entered.
The new branch, called newinterp, won&rsquo;t create those contexts anymore but they will be created only on-demand (e.g. thisContext). This means both less resources and garbage collector usage, and a possible speedup.
More informations on the mailing list here.
