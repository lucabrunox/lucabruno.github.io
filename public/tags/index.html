      Today I want to share a very simple script that works with most Linux window managers: switch window by name.
It works like this: you press Ctrl+Alt+M, then a dialog appears where you write part of the name of the window, and you&rsquo;ll get switched to the window that matches the provided name.The string your provide will match part of window names in case-insensitive mode.
That means if you have &ldquo;Foo - Mozilla Firefox&rdquo; and type in &ldquo;fire&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll switch to firefox.

      Welcome to the 19th Nix pill. In the previous 18th pill we did dive into the algorithm used by Nix to compute the store paths, and also introduced fixed-output store paths.
This time we will instead look into nixpkgs, in particular one of its core derivation: stdenv .
The stdenv is not a special derivation, but it&rsquo;s very important for the nixpkgs repository. It serves as base for packaging software. It is used to pull in dependencies such as the GCC toolchain, GNU make, core utilities, patch and diff utilities, and so on.

We&rsquo;ll be using declarative nixos containers, which do not use docker but systemd-nspawn. Also systemd is started as init system inside containers.
Please note that this configuration can be applied to any nixos machine, and also the containers configuration could be applied to real servers or other kinds of virtualization, e.

      I&rsquo;ve been using Go since several months. It&rsquo;s a pleasant language, even though it has its own drawbacks.
In our Nixpkgs repository we have support for several programming languages: perl, python, ruby, haskell, lua, &hellip; We&rsquo;ve merged a better support for Go.
What kind of support are we talking about? In Nix, you never install libraries. Instead, you define an environment in which to use a certain library compiled for a certain version of the language.

Before reading existing derivations, I&rsquo;d like to talk about store paths and how they are computed. In particular we are interested in fixed store paths that depend on an integrity hash (e.

Today we&rsquo;ll talk about a special attribute: config.packageOverrides. Overriding packages in a set with fixed point can be considered another design pattern in nixpkgs.
Overriding a package I recall the override design pattern from the nix pill 14.

Assuming you followed the previous posts, I hope you are now ready to understand nixpkgs. But we have to find nixpkgs in our system first! So this is the step: introducing some options and environment variables used by nix tools.

      Welcome to the 11th Nix pill. In the previous 10th pill we managed to obtain a self-contained environment for developing a project. The concept is that whereas nix-build is able to build a derivation in isolation, nix-shell is able to drop us in a shell with (almost) the same environment used by nix-build. This allows us to debug, modify and manually build software.
Today we stop packaging and look at a mandatory nix component, the garbage collector.

      Welcome to the 10th Nix pill. In the previous 9th pill we have seen one of the powerful features of nix, automatic discovery of runtime dependencies and finalized the GNU hello world package.
In return from vacation, we want to hack a little the GNU hello world program. The nix-build tool creates an isolated environment for building the derivation, we want to do the same in order to modify some source files of the project.

Today we stop by the GNU hello world program to analyze build and runtime dependencies, and enhance the builder in order to avoid unnecessary runtime dependencies.
Build dependencies Let&rsquo;s start analyzing build dependencies for our GNU hello world package:

      Introduction
Welcome to the first post of the Nix in pills series. Nix is a purely functional package manager and deployment system for POSIX. There&rsquo;s a lot of documentation that describes what Nix, NixOS and related projects are.
The purpose of this post is to convince you to give Nix a try. Installing NixOS is not required, but sometimes I may refer to NixOS as a real world example of Nix usage for building a whole operating system.

It turns out however that in NixOS wmctrl didn&rsquo;t work well. I had 3 windows opened, and wmctrl -l only showed one. Since gnome3 is still young in nixos, the first thought was that mutter did something wrong when returning the list of clients, due to some possible packaging mistake.

The stdenv is not a special derivation, but it&rsquo;s very important for the nixpkgs repository. It serves as base for packaging software. It is used to pull in dependencies such as the GCC toolchain, GNU make, core utilities, patch and diff utilities, and so on.

      Welcome to the 13th Nix pill. In the previous 12th pill we have introduced the first basic design pattern for organizing a repository of software. In addition we packaged graphviz to have at least another package for our little repository.
The next design pattern worth noting is what I&rsquo;d like to call the callPackage pattern. This technique is extensively used in nixpkgs, it&rsquo;s the current standard for importing packages in a repository.

      Welcome to the 11th Nix pill. In the previous 10th pill we managed to obtain a self-contained environment for developing a project. The concept is that whereas nix-build is able to build a derivation in isolation, nix-shell is able to drop us in a shell with (almost) the same environment used by nix-build. This allows us to debug, modify and manually build software.
Today we stop packaging and look at a mandatory nix component, the garbage collector.

      Introduction
Welcome to the first post of the Nix in pills series. Nix is a purely functional package manager and deployment system for POSIX. There&rsquo;s a lot of documentation that describes what Nix, NixOS and related projects are.
The purpose of this post is to convince you to give Nix a try. Installing NixOS is not required, but sometimes I may refer to NixOS as a real world example of Nix usage for building a whole operating system.

It turns out however that in NixOS wmctrl didn&rsquo;t work well. I had 3 windows opened, and wmctrl -l only showed one. Since gnome3 is still young in nixos, the first thought was that mutter did something wrong when returning the list of clients, due to some possible packaging mistake.

What kind of support are we talking about? In Nix, you never install libraries. Instead, you define an environment in which to use a certain library compiled for a certain version of the language.

Assuming you followed the previous posts, I hope you are now ready to understand nixpkgs. But we have to find nixpkgs in our system first! So this is the step: introducing some options and environment variables used by nix tools.
The NIX_PATH The NIX_PATH environment variable is very important.

      Welcome to the 14th Nix pill. In the previous 13th pill we have introduced the callPackage pattern, used to simplify the composition of software in a repository.
The next design pattern is less necessary but useful in many cases and it&rsquo;s a good exercise to learn more about Nix.
About composability Functional languages are known for being able to compose functions. In particular, you gain a lot from functions that are able to manipulate the original value into a new value having the same structure.

      Welcome to the 11th Nix pill. In the previous 10th pill we managed to obtain a self-contained environment for developing a project. The concept is that whereas nix-build is able to build a derivation in isolation, nix-shell is able to drop us in a shell with (almost) the same environment used by nix-build. This allows us to debug, modify and manually build software.
Today we stop packaging and look at a mandatory nix component, the garbage collector.

      Introduction
Welcome to the first post of the Nix in pills series. Nix is a purely functional package manager and deployment system for POSIX. There&rsquo;s a lot of documentation that describes what Nix, NixOS and related projects are.
The purpose of this post is to convince you to give Nix a try. Installing NixOS is not required, but sometimes I may refer to NixOS as a real world example of Nix usage for building a whole operating system.

      Hello,
the post below is copied straight from here.
Here I&rsquo;ll show a cool snippet code making use Vala async functions and iterators for emulating Python/Ruby generators. Creating a generator is as simple as extending the Generator class and implementing the generate() method.
abstract class Generator { private bool consumed; private G value; private SourceFunc callback; public Generator () { helper (); } private async void helper () { yield generate (); consumed \= true; } protected abstract async void generate (); protected async void feed (G value) { this.

      Hello,
I&rsquo;m using emacs since a long time by now. Everytime I ask myself why I&rsquo;m using it, given emacs certainly isn&rsquo;t the easiest environment for programming. So, I often tried to replace emacs with other IDEs or editors, using several extensions and so on, but I still miss these killer features in a single editor:
Pressing a key (whatever it is, TAB in emacs) correctly/smartly indent the row according to the current language.

I&rsquo;m trying to see if I&rsquo;m able to write some binary file using bash. So, when writing a binary file you often want to write a number into binary format. I ended up with this simple function for writing numbers in little endian:
function num2bin() { printf $(printf %.$(($2\*2))x\\\\n $1| sed &#39;s/\\(\[0-9a-f\]\[0-9a-f\]\\)/\\\\x\\1/g&#39;)| awk -F &#39;&#39; &#39;{ printf $4$3$2$1 }&#39; } The first parameter is the number to write, the second is the number of bytes (up to 4).

I&rsquo;ve just released the first version of Maja, the Vala to Javascript compiler. The mapping is not quite complete but you can do pretty much everything you could do with javascript directly. There are (still incomplete) bindings for the qooxdoo framework and the demo browser is being ported to vala successfully.
Maja can be used in any environments, not only web browsers.
Programming in Vala saves you from lots of type safety troubles (Javascript), lot of typing (Java) and the syntax is really enjoyable as it is quite close to the Javascript model.

Clutter is a 3D canvas and animation toolkit while Blender is a 3D modelling suite.

Valagtkdoc is a tool that integrates Vala with GTK-Doc for documentation generation.
You can find download and example usage at the homepage.
I think it&rsquo;s far from being perfect, and actually I haven&rsquo;t tried integrating it with autotools, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard. Unfortunately, you have to somehow break the gtk-doc rule &ldquo;do not run it manually&rdquo; because valagtkdoc goes in the middle between gtkdoc-scan and gtkdoc-mkdb.

Hello,
I&rsquo;m officializing the change of web hosting and git hosting from googlecode to berlios:
_
The new website is up!
For several reasons, including reliability, we switched both the website and git hosting to berlios. Also the purpose of this change is to rewrite the website backend using Syx.
The mailing list and the bug tracker are still hosted at googlecode.
Some progress news in the while
We&rsquo;re working on a new memory management, object representation and garbage collector.

      Hello,
I&rsquo;m recently writing a game with Java AWT/Swing/SwingX/JMF for a university exam.
If you are using the Java Media Framework and most of the formats (all the well known and used formats) can&rsquo;t be handled by the library here&rsquo;s your definitive solution to the problem.
You will usually get &ldquo;Unable to handle format: MPEG&rdquo; or something like that.
How do you get rid of that and make things work? There&rsquo;s a great plugin named jffmpeg which handles a huge number of audio and video formats (including ogg/vob).

      Hello,
lately I&rsquo;ve been looking for a way to create a desktop-wide keybinding for FreeSpeak.
I first looked into Tomboy and Deskbar source codes but the egg was too huge to be adopted, and it would have brought C dependency which isn&rsquo;t always nice for a Python project.
Then fargiolas pointed me to a blog post where I could find about gnome keybindings owned by gnome control center. Well that was only a mirage as it doesn&rsquo;t really grab the key but it&rsquo;s only a visual entry in the keyboard shortcuts preferences.

I decided to use DBus for making the application run only a single instance; when you try to open it again it won&rsquo;t start another process, instead it will use the already running one.
This is how I would create a generic single app instance with dbus-python:

dh_make is the first tool I&rsquo;ve used for the &ldquo;first debianization&rdquo; (called so by the New maintainers&rsquo; guide) which creates a basic template for your package.
Anyway after a few packagings I&rsquo;ve seen that something redundant could be automatized further.
What I suggest is a tool that does the following stuff after dh_make has been called:

      Hello,
you all know that Gtk+ has locks for the GUI when dealing with the X server and prevent async events to be sent. This is done by manually acquiring/releasing the lock on Gdk. Many Gtk+ ports don&rsquo;t do this automatically.
Syx used gtk_main() into a thread and automatically put gdk enter/leave for each function in its wrapper. It would be somewhat ugly in Smalltalk code having to enter/leave each time.

Smalltalk YX is currently working on refactoring a part of the interpreter, relative to contexts and stack management.
The current version uses one stack per process but always create contexts for each method or block entered.
The new branch, called newinterp, won&rsquo;t create those contexts anymore but they will be created only on-demand (e.g. thisContext). This means both less resources and garbage collector usage, and a possible speedup.

      One side of the idea:
Lately I&rsquo;ve seen some comment systems that inline comments in the text itself, see an example here.
Other side of the idea:
I&rsquo;ve implemented a couple of unsupervised algorithms for news text extraction from web pages in Javascript, and they work generally well. They&rsquo;re also capable of splitting the news text into paragraphs and avoid image captions or other unrelated text.
The idea:
Merge the two ideas, as a new commenting service (like Disqus) for blogs, in a modern and interesting way.

      Welcome to the 19th Nix pill. In the previous 18th pill we did dive into the algorithm used by Nix to compute the store paths, and also introduced fixed-output store paths.
This time we will instead look into nixpkgs, in particular one of its core derivation: stdenv .
The stdenv is not a special derivation, but it&rsquo;s very important for the nixpkgs repository. It serves as base for packaging software. It is used to pull in dependencies such as the GCC toolchain, GNU make, core utilities, patch and diff utilities, and so on.

      Welcome to the third Nix pill. In the previous second pill we have installed Nix on our running system. Now we can finally play with it a little, things also apply to NixOS users.
Enter the environment In the previous pill we created a nix user, so let&rsquo;s start by switching user with su - nix. If your ~/.profile got evaluated, then you should now be able to run commands like nix-env and nix-store.

      Welcome to the second Nix pill. In the first pill we briefly described Nix.
Now we&rsquo;ll install Nix on our running system and understand what changed in our system after the installation.
Nix installation is as easy as installing any other package. It will not revolutionize our system, it will stay in its own place out of our way.

      Introduction
Welcome to the first post of the Nix in pills series. Nix is a purely functional package manager and deployment system for POSIX. There&rsquo;s a lot of documentation that describes what Nix, NixOS and related projects are.
The purpose of this post is to convince you to give Nix a try. Installing NixOS is not required, but sometimes I may refer to NixOS as a real world example of Nix usage for building a whole operating system.

      I&rsquo;ve been using Go since several months. It&rsquo;s a pleasant language, even though it has its own drawbacks.
In our Nixpkgs repository we have support for several programming languages: perl, python, ruby, haskell, lua, &hellip; We&rsquo;ve merged a better support for Go.
What kind of support are we talking about? In Nix, you never install libraries. Instead, you define an environment in which to use a certain library compiled for a certain version of the language.

      Today I want to share a very simple script that works with most Linux window managers: switch window by name.
It works like this: you press Ctrl+Alt+M, then a dialog appears where you write part of the name of the window, and you&rsquo;ll get switched to the window that matches the provided name.The string your provide will match part of window names in case-insensitive mode.
That means if you have &ldquo;Foo - Mozilla Firefox&rdquo; and type in &ldquo;fire&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll switch to firefox.

I&rsquo;m using emacs since a long time by now. Everytime I ask myself why I&rsquo;m using it, given emacs certainly isn&rsquo;t the easiest environment for programming. So, I often tried to replace emacs with other IDEs or editors, using several extensions and so on, but I still miss these killer features in a single editor:
Pressing a key (whatever it is, TAB in emacs) correctly/smartly indent the row according to the current language.

Today I noticed that the idle may be too late: if the user is writing something, then some key strokes may be lost because the idle runs slightly after the widget has been mapped.

recently Mash has been released. It is a library for reading models in PLY format and creating Clutter actors from them. For reference, Blender is able to export to PLY. It means you can draw your models with Blender and use Clutter as rendering engine.
Clutter is a 3D canvas and animation toolkit while Blender is a 3D modelling suite.

      Hello,
I&rsquo;m writing about the work done in the bug triage weekend of the Debian/GNOME team, started at 27th Feb and ended in 28th Feb.
The result is great, 167 bugs have been closed and many more have been triaged and forwarded upstream.
Thanks to everybody who contributed, especially to whom has done it for the first time (well, you can still continue working on the remaining bugs ;) ).

I&rsquo;m lately following the Vala development and finally we got a new release with plenty of bug fixes and enhancements which makes Vala even more interesting and usable as general purpose language.
Here&rsquo;s the announcement.
I&rsquo;d like to point you to the new Vala journal, a good resource to stay tuned with Vala changes periodically.
News:
* Support coalescing operator ??.
* Support to_string and bitwise complement with enums.

a while ago I&rsquo;ve been talking about pango cairo and how to generate pdf with a couple of tables.
In the meantime I&rsquo;ve worked on it, improving and enhancing new kinds of elements. This has lead to the creation of a small project, a library providing a simple framework for generating mostly PDF reports (I haven&rsquo;t tried to generate SVG or something else yet).
After a couple of release requests, I&rsquo;ve found finally the time to publish a sort of working code.

      Hello,
lately I was wondering if there was any alternative to the well known reportlab python software for creating PDF reports. I immediately thought about Cairo. The only two problems are:
Cairo doesn&rsquo;t create multiple pages No support for creating tables containing text, necessary for table-based reports I still can&rsquo;t realize how to achieve the first feature, but the second one could be solved using Pango layouts.
The idea is to create the cells of the table using such layouts, so that the text get wrapped etc.

sometimes in the code of a couple of projects I see some hard algorithms to transform a pixbuf in a cairo surface.
Maybe most of people don&rsquo;t know that GdkCairoContext, contrarily to cairo_t, is created against a cairo context not a cairo surface:
`surface = cairo.ImageSurface (cairo.FORMAT_ARGB32, pixbuf.get_width(), pixbuf.get_height())
cr = cairo.Context (surface)
gdkcr = gtk.gdk.CairoContext (cr)
gdkcr.set_source_pixbuf (pixbuf)
gdkcr.paint ()`
Notice gtk.gdk.CairoContext (cr), which cr is not the surface.

      Hello,
lately I&rsquo;ve been looking for a way to create a desktop-wide keybinding for FreeSpeak.
I first looked into Tomboy and Deskbar source codes but the egg was too huge to be adopted, and it would have brought C dependency which isn&rsquo;t always nice for a Python project.
Then fargiolas pointed me to a blog post where I could find about gnome keybindings owned by gnome control center. Well that was only a mirage as it doesn&rsquo;t really grab the key but it&rsquo;s only a visual entry in the keyboard shortcuts preferences.

I&rsquo;m working on FreeSpeak lately and I needed to run the application once per session, as it&rsquo;s got a trayicon and a notebook (maybe windows with an applet is better?)
I decided to use DBus for making the application run only a single instance; when you try to open it again it won&rsquo;t start another process, instead it will use the already running one.
This is how I would create a generic single app instance with dbus-python:

      Hello,
I&rsquo;m using Twitter in this week and the API works &ldquo;almost&rdquo; perfectly while the website is down most of the time.
I&rsquo;ve recently heard about identi.ca, so I decided to try it.
My first impression was bad, because I&rsquo;ve seen many redirects of the page, and DNS changes sometimes.
But ok, I tried to register and again&hellip; I had problems. When I submitted the registration twice it just did nothing.

      Hello,
you all know that Gtk+ has locks for the GUI when dealing with the X server and prevent async events to be sent. This is done by manually acquiring/releasing the lock on Gdk. Many Gtk+ ports don&rsquo;t do this automatically.
Syx used gtk_main() into a thread and automatically put gdk enter/leave for each function in its wrapper. It would be somewhat ugly in Smalltalk code having to enter/leave each time.

      Many times I had to give focus to a newly created Gtk widget that still had to be mapped to screen. Since widget.grab_focus() does not work if the widget is not displayed on the screen, then I always used an idle source to delay the operation.
Today I noticed that the idle may be too late: if the user is writing something, then some key strokes may be lost because the idle runs slightly after the widget has been mapped.

Valagtkdoc is a tool that integrates Vala with GTK-Doc for documentation generation.
You can find download and example usage at the homepage.
I think it&rsquo;s far from being perfect, and actually I haven&rsquo;t tried integrating it with autotools, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard. Unfortunately, you have to somehow break the gtk-doc rule &ldquo;do not run it manually&rdquo; because valagtkdoc goes in the middle between gtkdoc-scan and gtkdoc-mkdb.

Then fargiolas pointed me to a blog post where I could find about gnome keybindings owned by gnome control center. Well that was only a mirage as it doesn&rsquo;t really grab the key but it&rsquo;s only a visual entry in the keyboard shortcuts preferences.

      Hello,
you all know that Gtk+ has locks for the GUI when dealing with the X server and prevent async events to be sent. This is done by manually acquiring/releasing the lock on Gdk. Many Gtk+ ports don&rsquo;t do this automatically.
Syx used gtk_main() into a thread and automatically put gdk enter/leave for each function in its wrapper. It would be somewhat ugly in Smalltalk code having to enter/leave each time.

      I&rsquo;m going to introduce you a very nice alternative to make: the Shake build system, by setting up a builder for your Vala application project.
First of all, you need to know that Shake is a library written in Haskell, and it&rsquo;s meant to be a better replacement for make. Let&rsquo;s start by installing cabal and then shake:
apt-get install cabal-install cabal update cabal install shake TL;DR; this is the final Build.

      Many times I had to give focus to a newly created Gtk widget that still had to be mapped to screen. Since widget.grab_focus() does not work if the widget is not displayed on the screen, then I always used an idle source to delay the operation.
Today I noticed that the idle may be too late: if the user is writing something, then some key strokes may be lost because the idle runs slightly after the widget has been mapped.

I&rsquo;ve just released the first version of Maja, the Vala to Javascript compiler. The mapping is not quite complete but you can do pretty much everything you could do with javascript directly. There are (still incomplete) bindings for the qooxdoo framework and the demo browser is being ported to vala successfully.
Maja can be used in any environments, not only web browsers.
Programming in Vala saves you from lots of type safety troubles (Javascript), lot of typing (Java) and the syntax is really enjoyable as it is quite close to the Javascript model.

Valagtkdoc is a tool that integrates Vala with GTK-Doc for documentation generation.

I think it&rsquo;s far from being perfect, and actually I haven&rsquo;t tried integrating it with autotools, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard. Unfortunately, you have to somehow break the gtk-doc rule &ldquo;do not run it manually&rdquo; because valagtkdoc goes in the middle between gtkdoc-scan and gtkdoc-mkdb.

      I&rsquo;m going to introduce you a very nice alternative to make: the Shake build system, by setting up a builder for your Vala application project.
First of all, you need to know that Shake is a library written in Haskell, and it&rsquo;s meant to be a better replacement for make. Let&rsquo;s start by installing cabal and then shake:
apt-get install cabal-install cabal update cabal install shake TL;DR; this is the final Build.

in this post I&rsquo;d like to hint you a very nice search engine: DuckDuckGo. I&rsquo;ve been pointed out to this by a post here on why both Google and Yahoo suck (and why Google search does more).
In older posts of mine you can find some examples on how Google search can miserably fail a search.
The main problem with the two approaches is: Google (and Bing too) sorts by popularity, Yahoo by match.

      Hello,
Google Reader has just wiped out my subscriptions list, which made me scream like a crazy monkey (other than cleaning up the list).Now I&rsquo;m using bloglines, which looks pretty good except there&rsquo;s nothing like &ldquo;read all items&rdquo;, but you must clean on each feed to see the items (any alternative to bloglines supporting this?).
But as far as I can see, I&rsquo;m not the only one that lost the feeds, the difference is that I just opened the reader without any other operation.

sometimes ago I posted twice about google search having wrong results.
Now it happens again after a few months (it&rsquo;s like google breaks page weights like every 4-5 months).
The search is &ldquo;debian dpkg list&rdquo;, I really expect the mailing list info page but after 3-4 pages of google search (and also bing this time) I couldn&rsquo;t find it. With yahoo search it&rsquo;s at the first position (lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg).
Like for the previous posts, using different search engines matters and matches your needs.

Lately I&rsquo;ve seen some comment systems that inline comments in the text itself, see an example here.
Other side of the idea:
I&rsquo;ve implemented a couple of unsupervised algorithms for news text extraction from web pages in Javascript, and they work generally well. They&rsquo;re also capable of splitting the news text into paragraphs and avoid image captions or other unrelated text.
The idea:
Merge the two ideas, as a new commenting service (like Disqus) for blogs, in a modern and interesting way.

      Hello again,
this time I&rsquo;ve found a version of bubble sort here. I wanted to provide my version, which is less iterative and, I think, more intuitive. What it does is, simply, bubble until it&rsquo;s sorted:
bubblesort(L1, L2) :- bubblesort2(L1,L2,unsorted),!. bubblesort2(L,L,sorted). bubblesort2(L1,L2,unsorted) :- bubble(L1,L3,C), bubblesort2(L3,L2,C). bubble(\[\],\[\],sorted). bubble(\[X\],\[X\],sorted). bubble(\[X,Y|L\], \[X|L1\], C) :- X &lt;= Y, bubble(\[Y|L\],L1,C). bubble(\[X,Y|L\], \[Y|L1\], unsorted) :- X \&gt; Y, bubble(\[X|L\],L1,\_). Yes, the exam is tomorrow so I will finally stop annoying you readers ;)

      Hello,
an exam exercise requires me to write a matrix transpose method. I&rsquo;ve written one and it took a little before I was able to define it completely in 4 rules.
I&rsquo;m curious then I&rsquo;ve found this on stackoverflow: the approach is to calculate first transposed column, then shift by one column and calculate the transpose of that new matrix.
This was one of the first solutions I&rsquo;ve thought but I haven&rsquo;t realized it because I&rsquo;m too lazy to create a rule for calculating the shifted matrix.

        Accessing simple private fields in PHP

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      A way of accessing private fields in PHP is by changing the accessibility of the fields themselves with http://php.net/manual/en/reflectionproperty.setaccessible.php.
However this approach requires PHP 5.3.
For PHP &lt; 5.3 there&rsquo;s another subtle way of accessing private properties:
function getPrivateProperty($fixture, $propname) {
try {
$arr = (array)$fixture;
} catch (Exception $e) {
}
$class = get_class($fixture);
$privname = &ldquo;\0$class\0$propname&rdquo;;
return $arr[$privname];
}
Usage is pretty straightforward, pass in the object and the property name as string.

      Hello,
I&rsquo;m trying to see if I&rsquo;m able to write some binary file using bash. So, when writing a binary file you often want to write a number into binary format. I ended up with this simple function for writing numbers in little endian:
function num2bin() { printf $(printf %.$(($2\*2))x\\\\n $1| sed &#39;s/\\(\[0-9a-f\]\[0-9a-f\]\\)/\\\\x\\1/g&#39;)| awk -F &#39;&#39; &#39;{ printf $4$3$2$1 }&#39; } The first parameter is the number to write, the second is the number of bytes (up to 4).

      I use awesome on my eeepc because it&rsquo;s much space and resource saving.
There are several possibilities for controlling volume in the Awesome window manager.
Today I&rsquo;d like to share my way of doing it: using amixer for controlling the volume, and naughty for notifying the user.
Start by defining the following in your rc.lua (source discussion here):
volnotify = {}
volnotify.id = nil
function volnotify:notify (msg)
self.id = naughty.notify({ text = msg, timeout = 1, replaces_id = self.

      Hello,
due to the high resource usage by Eclipse (I have to use that unfortunately because of my professor) I&rsquo;ve temporarly dropped GNOME and now I&rsquo;m using Awesome for a while.
Ok let&rsquo;s say the problem: the keyboard. Do you have different languages, layouts and so on among several configurations (GNOME, X, &hellip;) and your keyboard layout is messed up with awesome?
Just do it:
setxkbmap -layout YOURLAYOUT
Where YOURLAYOUT for me is it.

Then I&rsquo;ve realized that other commands such as &ldquo;ls&rdquo; actually expand variables. I looked for some &ldquo;complete&rdquo; combo used for &ldquo;ls&rdquo; but not for &ldquo;cd&rdquo; in /etc/bash_completion and I came out with the following:

The answer is&hellip; yes! You can use what you want in the order you want, and use tdpkg when you want. Take in consideration that after using dpkg (or apt) without tdpkg, then you use tdpkg the cache will be rebuilt for consistency.
It&rsquo;s not working here (Ubuntu, other distro&hellip;), doesn&rsquo;t create the cache.

      Hello,
you may have noticed that dpkg takes a long time reading the database the first time you run it (e.g. through apt). This is because of the huge number of /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list files (1700+ on my desktop machines). It can take up to 14 seconds and more at cold start to install/remove a single package.
Since 2007 in dpkg mailing list a first proposal (by Sean Finney) to using sqlite as cache has been posted, then a couple of weeks ago I reproposed it.

With versions of the linux kernel prior to 2.6.20 (maybe) I could install zd1211 firmware using the module-assistant which has been now dropped from testing and unstable.

      Hello,
this is my second post about Debian. I&rsquo;m lately discovering all the tools for both managing my Debian system and creating packages.
dh_make is the first tool I&rsquo;ve used for the &ldquo;first debianization&rdquo; (called so by the New maintainers&rsquo; guide) which creates a basic template for your package.
Anyway after a few packagings I&rsquo;ve seen that something redundant could be automatized further.
What I suggest is a tool that does the following stuff after dh_make has been called:

      Hello,
I switched to Debian lately and i think it will become my preferred distribution.
I started with Slackware, then an LFS and then Gentoo. I never found them definitive for me.
I used Slackware by compiling sources most of all, then i didn&rsquo;t see any reason to continue using it.
The LFS came since my new PC as a test, and as long I could maintain it I had no problems and had fun with it.

(from the about page):
It searches all the open source projects which are included in the Debian archive (the &ldquo;main&rdquo; distribution only, not non-free or contrib). Currently, that includes about 18000 packages with 140 GiB of source code.

The search is &ldquo;debian dpkg list&rdquo;, I really expect the mailing list info page but after 3-4 pages of google search (and also bing this time) I couldn&rsquo;t find it. With yahoo search it&rsquo;s at the first position (lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg).

since a few days facebook is supporting SSL for the chat. The problem is that it can&rsquo;t be enabled.
Until facebook enables this you can use the SSLGuard plugin for firefox, which enforces SSL for a list of web sites, including all facebook pages and the chat as well.
We have some good ideas for sslguard that we&rsquo;d like to get in for the next releases&hellip; stay tuned.

      Hello,
I&rsquo;ve just released the first version of Maja, the Vala to Javascript compiler. The mapping is not quite complete but you can do pretty much everything you could do with javascript directly. There are (still incomplete) bindings for the qooxdoo framework and the demo browser is being ported to vala successfully.
Maja can be used in any environments, not only web browsers.
Programming in Vala saves you from lots of type safety troubles (Javascript), lot of typing (Java) and the syntax is really enjoyable as it is quite close to the Javascript model.

I first looked into Tomboy and Deskbar source codes but the egg was too huge to be adopted, and it would have brought C dependency which isn&rsquo;t always nice for a Python project.
Then fargiolas pointed me to a blog post where I could find about gnome keybindings owned by gnome control center. Well that was only a mirage as it doesn&rsquo;t really grab the key but it&rsquo;s only a visual entry in the keyboard shortcuts preferences.

Then I&rsquo;ve realized that other commands such as &ldquo;ls&rdquo; actually expand variables. I looked for some &ldquo;complete&rdquo; combo used for &ldquo;ls&rdquo; but not for &ldquo;cd&rdquo; in /etc/bash_completion and I came out with the following:

      Hello,
I&rsquo;m trying to see if I&rsquo;m able to write some binary file using bash. So, when writing a binary file you often want to write a number into binary format. I ended up with this simple function for writing numbers in little endian:
function num2bin() { printf $(printf %.$(($2\*2))x\\\\n $1| sed &#39;s/\\(\[0-9a-f\]\[0-9a-f\]\\)/\\\\x\\1/g&#39;)| awk -F &#39;&#39; &#39;{ printf $4$3$2$1 }&#39; } The first parameter is the number to write, the second is the number of bytes (up to 4).

In order to parse MIME parts with base64 or quopri content-transfer-encoding I chose to implement a couple of GConverter (will use GMime a day, maybe when they switch to gio, not yet needed) in Vala that you can find here:

In older posts of mine you can find some examples on how Google search can miserably fail a search.
The main problem with the two approaches is: Google (and Bing too) sorts by popularity, Yahoo by match.

      Hello,
sometimes ago I posted twice about google search having wrong results.
Now it happens again after a few months (it&rsquo;s like google breaks page weights like every 4-5 months).
The search is &ldquo;debian dpkg list&rdquo;, I really expect the mailing list info page but after 3-4 pages of google search (and also bing this time) I couldn&rsquo;t find it. With yahoo search it&rsquo;s at the first position (lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg).
Like for the previous posts, using different search engines matters and matches your needs.

as promised this is the second post, this time for dictionaries. The most important thing to notice is that tbl[key]=nil means deleting the entry from the table, while in python dict[key]=None is still a valid entry with None value.
Here&rsquo;s the snippet you can launch in a lua interpreter and this is the catalog of python dictionary examples.

      Hello,
lately I&rsquo;m discovering Lua as general purpose language. Many people don&rsquo;t agree with lua being used as a general purpose language, many others (including a newbie like me) think Lua has such a simple syntax and powerful tables to become a full fledged language.
I use a lot of Python, so I start from here: what Python does that Lua can&rsquo;t do almost in the same way? Read the question as it is, don&rsquo;t read &ldquo;what Python does that Lua can&rsquo;t do&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s different.

Is it compatible with apt? Can I use dpkg back again after using tdpkg?
The answer is&hellip; yes! You can use what you want in the order you want, and use tdpkg when you want. Take in consideration that after using dpkg (or apt) without tdpkg, then you use tdpkg the cache will be rebuilt for consistency.
It&rsquo;s not working here (Ubuntu, other distro&hellip;), doesn&rsquo;t create the cache.

      Hello,
you may have noticed that dpkg takes a long time reading the database the first time you run it (e.g. through apt). This is because of the huge number of /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list files (1700+ on my desktop machines). It can take up to 14 seconds and more at cold start to install/remove a single package.
Since 2007 in dpkg mailing list a first proposal (by Sean Finney) to using sqlite as cache has been posted, then a couple of weeks ago I reproposed it.

      Hello,
recently Mash has been released. It is a library for reading models in PLY format and creating Clutter actors from them. For reference, Blender is able to export to PLY. It means you can draw your models with Blender and use Clutter as rendering engine.
Clutter is a 3D canvas and animation toolkit while Blender is a 3D modelling suite.
What I&rsquo;ve tested so far is porting the Monkey Viewer C example to Vala: code snippet and monkey PLY here.

      Hello,
sometimes in the code of a couple of projects I see some hard algorithms to transform a pixbuf in a cairo surface.
Maybe most of people don&rsquo;t know that GdkCairoContext, contrarily to cairo_t, is created against a cairo context not a cairo surface:
`surface = cairo.ImageSurface (cairo.FORMAT_ARGB32, pixbuf.get_width(), pixbuf.get_height())
cr = cairo.Context (surface)
gdkcr = gtk.gdk.CairoContext (cr)
gdkcr.set_source_pixbuf (pixbuf)
gdkcr.paint ()`
Notice gtk.gdk.CairoContext (cr), which cr is not the surface.

      Hello,
I&rsquo;ve just released the first version of Maja, the Vala to Javascript compiler. The mapping is not quite complete but you can do pretty much everything you could do with javascript directly. There are (still incomplete) bindings for the qooxdoo framework and the demo browser is being ported to vala successfully.
Maja can be used in any environments, not only web browsers.
Programming in Vala saves you from lots of type safety troubles (Javascript), lot of typing (Java) and the syntax is really enjoyable as it is quite close to the Javascript model.

Now it happens again after a few months (it&rsquo;s like google breaks page weights like every 4-5 months).
The search is &ldquo;debian dpkg list&rdquo;, I really expect the mailing list info page but after 3-4 pages of google search (and also bing this time) I couldn&rsquo;t find it. With yahoo search it&rsquo;s at the first position (lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg).

      Hello,
I&rsquo;ve written a MIPS32 (Release 2) disassembler for ELF files. It is not a simple disassembler, it&rsquo;s mostly made for reverse engineering proprietary boxes for educational purposes. It has been successfully tested on Vodafone Station which has Broadcom binaries. These boxes don&rsquo;t have a sections table, therefore normal disassemblers don&rsquo;t work. Mipsdis instead will guess the bounds of those sections (most important ones are TEXT and RODATA for strings).

Valagtkdoc is a tool that integrates Vala with GTK-Doc for documentation generation.
You can find download and example usage at the homepage.
I think it&rsquo;s far from being perfect, and actually I haven&rsquo;t tried integrating it with autotools, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard. Unfortunately, you have to somehow break the gtk-doc rule &ldquo;do not run it manually&rdquo; because valagtkdoc goes in the middle between gtkdoc-scan and gtkdoc-mkdb.

Is it compatible with apt? Can I use dpkg back again after using tdpkg?
The answer is&hellip; yes! You can use what you want in the order you want, and use tdpkg when you want. Take in consideration that after using dpkg (or apt) without tdpkg, then you use tdpkg the cache will be rebuilt for consistency.
It&rsquo;s not working here (Ubuntu, other distro&hellip;), doesn&rsquo;t create the cache.

      Hello,
you may have noticed that dpkg takes a long time reading the database the first time you run it (e.g. through apt). This is because of the huge number of /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list files (1700+ on my desktop machines). It can take up to 14 seconds and more at cold start to install/remove a single package.
Since 2007 in dpkg mailing list a first proposal (by Sean Finney) to using sqlite as cache has been posted, then a couple of weeks ago I reproposed it.

      Hello,
I&rsquo;m writing to let you know of the first release of SDChat.
It is a protocol with libraries and programs to create secure IM networks using GPG and RSA.
All the stack is written in Python but the page says it will be rewritten from scratch to provide a C API.
It features a GTK+ interface with many plugins (unfortunately audio and video are being broken due to gstreamer updates) and a simple server for routing.

      Hello,
I&rsquo;m lately using the Vala language widely. I find it a great and well designed language.
You may know I&rsquo;m the maintainer of Freespeak. This program is written in Python. Now I&rsquo;m rewriting it in Vala, both for providing a good and really simple API in C and for learning Vala.
I will now paste a snippet from the new freespeak code that I use for creating a cancellable asyncronous operation for fetching a web page using libsoup either with a GET or a POST method.

as promised this is the second post, this time for dictionaries. The most important thing to notice is that tbl[key]=nil means deleting the entry from the table, while in python dict[key]=None is still a valid entry with None value.

      Hello,
lately I&rsquo;m discovering Lua as general purpose language. Many people don&rsquo;t agree with lua being used as a general purpose language, many others (including a newbie like me) think Lua has such a simple syntax and powerful tables to become a full fledged language.
I use a lot of Python, so I start from here: what Python does that Lua can&rsquo;t do almost in the same way? Read the question as it is, don&rsquo;t read &ldquo;what Python does that Lua can&rsquo;t do&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s different.

      Hello,
a while ago I&rsquo;ve been talking about pango cairo and how to generate pdf with a couple of tables.
In the meantime I&rsquo;ve worked on it, improving and enhancing new kinds of elements. This has lead to the creation of a small project, a library providing a simple framework for generating mostly PDF reports (I haven&rsquo;t tried to generate SVG or something else yet).
After a couple of release requests, I&rsquo;ve found finally the time to publish a sort of working code.

      Hello,
lately I was wondering if there was any alternative to the well known reportlab python software for creating PDF reports. I immediately thought about Cairo. The only two problems are:
Cairo doesn&rsquo;t create multiple pages No support for creating tables containing text, necessary for table-based reports I still can&rsquo;t realize how to achieve the first feature, but the second one could be solved using Pango layouts.
The idea is to create the cells of the table using such layouts, so that the text get wrapped etc.

sometimes in the code of a couple of projects I see some hard algorithms to transform a pixbuf in a cairo surface.
Maybe most of people don&rsquo;t know that GdkCairoContext, contrarily to cairo_t, is created against a cairo context not a cairo surface:
`surface = cairo.ImageSurface (cairo.FORMAT_ARGB32, pixbuf.get_width(), pixbuf.get_height())
cr = cairo.Context (surface)
gdkcr = gtk.gdk.CairoContext (cr)
gdkcr.set_source_pixbuf (pixbuf)
gdkcr.paint ()`
Notice gtk.gdk.CairoContext (cr), which cr is not the surface.

Ok let&rsquo;s say the problem: the keyboard. Do you have different languages, layouts and so on among several configurations (GNOME, X, &hellip;) and your keyboard layout is messed up with awesome?
Just do it:
setxkbmap -layout YOURLAYOUT
Where YOURLAYOUT for me is it.

      Hello,
I&rsquo;m recently writing a game with Java AWT/Swing/SwingX/JMF for a university exam.
If you are using the Java Media Framework and most of the formats (all the well known and used formats) can&rsquo;t be handled by the library here&rsquo;s your definitive solution to the problem.
You will usually get &ldquo;Unable to handle format: MPEG&rdquo; or something like that.
How do you get rid of that and make things work? There&rsquo;s a great plugin named jffmpeg which handles a huge number of audio and video formats (including ogg/vob).

a while ago I&rsquo;ve been talking about pango cairo and how to generate pdf with a couple of tables.
In the meantime I&rsquo;ve worked on it, improving and enhancing new kinds of elements. This has lead to the creation of a small project, a library providing a simple framework for generating mostly PDF reports (I haven&rsquo;t tried to generate SVG or something else yet).
After a couple of release requests, I&rsquo;ve found finally the time to publish a sort of working code.

a while ago I&rsquo;ve been talking about pango cairo and how to generate pdf with a couple of tables.

      Hello,
I&rsquo;m recently writing a game with Java AWT/Swing/SwingX/JMF for a university exam.
If you are using the Java Media Framework and most of the formats (all the well known and used formats) can&rsquo;t be handled by the library here&rsquo;s your definitive solution to the problem.
You will usually get &ldquo;Unable to handle format: MPEG&rdquo; or something like that.
How do you get rid of that and make things work? There&rsquo;s a great plugin named jffmpeg which handles a huge number of audio and video formats (including ogg/vob).

in the new branches of Syx (an open source Smalltalk-80 implementation) we&rsquo;re working to try a new kind of memory management and add many features that have been missed until now to focus on other stuff.
The new faster and more modern v0.1.8 release will contain the following refactoring:

      Hello,
you all know that Gtk+ has locks for the GUI when dealing with the X server and prevent async events to be sent. This is done by manually acquiring/releasing the lock on Gdk. Many Gtk+ ports don&rsquo;t do this automatically.
Syx used gtk_main() into a thread and automatically put gdk enter/leave for each function in its wrapper. It would be somewhat ugly in Smalltalk code having to enter/leave each time.

      Hello,
Smalltalk YX is currently working on refactoring a part of the interpreter, relative to contexts and stack management.
The current version uses one stack per process but always create contexts for each method or block entered.
The new branch, called newinterp, won&rsquo;t create those contexts anymore but they will be created only on-demand (e.g. thisContext). This means both less resources and garbage collector usage, and a possible speedup.

Hello,
I&rsquo;m officializing the change of web hosting and git hosting from googlecode to berlios:
_
The new website is up!
For several reasons, including reliability, we switched both the website and git hosting to berlios. Also the purpose of this change is to rewrite the website backend using Syx.
The mailing list and the bug tracker are still hosted at googlecode.
Some progress news in the while
We&rsquo;re working on a new memory management, object representation and garbage collector.

in the new branches of Syx (an open source Smalltalk-80 implementation) we&rsquo;re working to try a new kind of memory management and add many features that have been missed until now to focus on other stuff.
The new faster and more modern v0.1.8 release will contain the following refactoring:
Objects will be variable-length (minumum 12 bytes on 32-bit processors and 16 bytes on 64-bit processors)
By changing the objects also the GC changed to a mark and compact GC

This versions enhances a new version of the interpreter, major updates to the scheduler, and as usual a lot of bug fixes. Syx left the Google Code SVN repositories because of many connection problems.

      Hello,
you all know that Gtk+ has locks for the GUI when dealing with the X server and prevent async events to be sent. This is done by manually acquiring/releasing the lock on Gdk. Many Gtk+ ports don&rsquo;t do this automatically.
Syx used gtk_main() into a thread and automatically put gdk enter/leave for each function in its wrapper. It would be somewhat ugly in Smalltalk code having to enter/leave each time.

      Hello,
Smalltalk YX is currently working on refactoring a part of the interpreter, relative to contexts and stack management.
The current version uses one stack per process but always create contexts for each method or block entered.
The new branch, called newinterp, won&rsquo;t create those contexts anymore but they will be created only on-demand (e.g. thisContext). This means both less resources and garbage collector usage, and a possible speedup.
More informations on the mailing list here.

lately I&rsquo;ve been looking for a way to create a desktop-wide keybinding for FreeSpeak.
I first looked into Tomboy and Deskbar source codes but the egg was too huge to be adopted, and it would have brought C dependency which isn&rsquo;t always nice for a Python project.
Then fargiolas pointed me to a blog post where I could find about gnome keybindings owned by gnome control center. Well that was only a mirage as it doesn&rsquo;t really grab the key but it&rsquo;s only a visual entry in the keyboard shortcuts preferences.

      Hello,
I&rsquo;m using Twitter in this week and the API works &ldquo;almost&rdquo; perfectly while the website is down most of the time.
I&rsquo;ve recently heard about identi.ca, so I decided to try it.
My first impression was bad, because I&rsquo;ve seen many redirects of the page, and DNS changes sometimes.
But ok, I tried to register and again&hellip; I had problems. When I submitted the registration twice it just did nothing.
