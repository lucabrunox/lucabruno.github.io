      TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, the way you expect it to be.
I’ve heard of it a long time ago, but recently with TypeScript 1.7 it got async functions, which means you can awaitasynchronous function calls, similarly to C#, Vala, Go and other languages with syntax support for concurrency. That makes coroutines a pleasant experience compared to plain JavaScript. That’s also the main reason why I didn’t choose Dart.

      I&rsquo;m going to introduce you a very nice alternative to make: the Shake build system, by setting up a builder for your Vala application project.
First of all, you need to know that Shake is a library written in Haskell, and it&rsquo;s meant to be a better replacement for make. Let&rsquo;s start by installing cabal and then shake:
apt-get install cabal-install cabal update cabal install shake TL;DR; this is the final Build.

      Many times I had to give focus to a newly created Gtk widget that still had to be mapped to screen. Since widget.grab_focus() does not work if the widget is not displayed on the screen, then I always used an idle source to delay the operation.
Today I noticed that the idle may be too late: if the user is writing something, then some key strokes may be lost because the idle runs slightly after the widget has been mapped.

Pressing a key (whatever it is, TAB in emacs) correctly/smartly indent the row according to the current language.

I&rsquo;m trying to see if I&rsquo;m able to write some binary file using bash. So, when writing a binary file you often want to write a number into binary format. I ended up with this simple function for writing numbers in little endian:
function num2bin() { printf $(printf %.$(($2\*2))x\\\\n $1| sed &#39;s/\\(\[0-9a-f\]\[0-9a-f\]\\)/\\\\x\\1/g&#39;)| awk -F &#39;&#39; &#39;{ printf $4$3$2$1 }&#39; } The first parameter is the number to write, the second is the number of bytes (up to 4).

Until facebook enables this you can use the SSLGuard plugin for firefox, which enforces SSL for a list of web sites, including all facebook pages and the chat as well.
We have some good ideas for sslguard that we&rsquo;d like to get in for the next releases&hellip; stay tuned.

I&rsquo;ve just released the first version of Maja, the Vala to Javascript compiler. The mapping is not quite complete but you can do pretty much everything you could do with javascript directly.

Maja can be used in any environments, not only web browsers.
Programming in Vala saves you from lots of type safety troubles (Javascript), lot of typing (Java) and the syntax is really enjoyable as it is quite close to the Javascript model.

The code of the former extension is a lot more complicated and the result is not always quite the same as SSLGuard. In fact, while they support secure cookies and per-website custom rules, SSLGuard lets you add custom websites to be secured directly from a friendly graphical dialog.

Valagtkdoc is a tool that integrates Vala with GTK-Doc for documentation generation.
You can find download and example usage at the homepage.
I think it&rsquo;s far from being perfect, and actually I haven&rsquo;t tried integrating it with autotools, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard. Unfortunately, you have to somehow break the gtk-doc rule &ldquo;do not run it manually&rdquo; because valagtkdoc goes in the middle between gtkdoc-scan and gtkdoc-mkdb.

it&rsquo;s often useful for Vala hackers to have a graphical representation of the code tree and control flow blocks. Therefore I&rsquo;ve created a simple application called Valag which generates four types of diagrams using Graphviz for each state of the Vala compiler.
This is the first release, there&rsquo;re many things to fix and enhance (like command line options) but it is working quite good already to give support when hacking Vala.

lately I&rsquo;ve been looking for a way to create a desktop-wide keybinding for FreeSpeak.
I first looked into Tomboy and Deskbar source codes but the egg was too huge to be adopted, and it would have brought C dependency which isn&rsquo;t always nice for a Python project.
Then fargiolas pointed me to a blog post where I could find about gnome keybindings owned by gnome control center. Well that was only a mirage as it doesn&rsquo;t really grab the key but it&rsquo;s only a visual entry in the keyboard shortcuts preferences.

      Hello,
in the new branches of Syx (an open source Smalltalk-80 implementation) we&rsquo;re working to try a new kind of memory management and add many features that have been missed until now to focus on other stuff.
The new faster and more modern v0.1.8 release will contain the following refactoring:
Objects will be variable-length (minumum 12 bytes on 32-bit processors and 16 bytes on 64-bit processors)
By changing the objects also the GC changed to a mark and compact GC

      Hello,
this is my second post about Debian. I&rsquo;m lately discovering all the tools for both managing my Debian system and creating packages.
dh_make is the first tool I&rsquo;ve used for the &ldquo;first debianization&rdquo; (called so by the New maintainers&rsquo; guide) which creates a basic template for your package.
Anyway after a few packagings I&rsquo;ve seen that something redundant could be automatized further.
What I suggest is a tool that does the following stuff after dh_make has been called:

      Hello,
after several months a new version of Syx has been released. This release contains mostly VM changes and some changes to the Smalltalk Collections. As usual, release notes follow:
This versions enhances a new version of the interpreter, major updates to the scheduler, and as usual a lot of bug fixes. Syx left the Google Code SVN repositories because of many connection problems.
You can find informations about the new GIT repository here: http://code.

      Hello,
you all know that Gtk+ has locks for the GUI when dealing with the X server and prevent async events to be sent. This is done by manually acquiring/releasing the lock on Gdk. Many Gtk+ ports don&rsquo;t do this automatically.
Syx used gtk_main() into a thread and automatically put gdk enter/leave for each function in its wrapper. It would be somewhat ugly in Smalltalk code having to enter/leave each time.

Hello,
with the next release 0.1.7, once I get a working interpreter and updated all the parts of Syx,
I will move output of doxygen to doc/reference and start a texinfo manual in doc/manual.
My idea is to have this kind of manual:
What is Smalltalk Why Smalltalk YX Introduction to the language Introduction the Syx environment COMPLETE Class and methods documentation, EACH non private method will be documented with examples

      Hello,
I switched to Debian lately and i think it will become my preferred distribution.
I started with Slackware, then an LFS and then Gentoo. I never found them definitive for me.
I used Slackware by compiling sources most of all, then i didn&rsquo;t see any reason to continue using it.
The LFS came since my new PC as a test, and as long I could maintain it I had no problems and had fun with it.

      Hello,
Smalltalk YX is currently working on refactoring a part of the interpreter, relative to contexts and stack management.
The current version uses one stack per process but always create contexts for each method or block entered.
The new branch, called newinterp, won&rsquo;t create those contexts anymore but they will be created only on-demand (e.g. thisContext). This means both less resources and garbage collector usage, and a possible speedup.
More informations on the mailing list here.
