<p>since I&rsquo;ve started using <a href="http://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a>, a great shell with great out of the box completion, one of the most boring issues was having a really slow completion. I can understand it could be slow to get a list of packages, remote files or command line options, but also paths were often slow to be completed. After lots of searches I&rsquo;ve ended up in adding this magic line to my ~/.zshrc:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>zstyle &lsquo;:completion:*&rsquo; accept-exact &lsquo;*(N)&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This way you tell zsh comp to take the first part of the path to be exact, and to avoid partial globs. Now path completions became nearly immediate.</p>
<p>Another important speed up is using the cache for packages and other stuff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>zstyle &lsquo;:completion:*&rsquo; use-cache on</p>
<p>zstyle &lsquo;:completion:*&rsquo; cache-path ~/.zsh/cache</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you know how to boost up options/remote files, please share :)</p>
