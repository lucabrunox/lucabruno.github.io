I switched to Debian lately and i think it will become my preferred distribution.<br>
I started with Slackware, then an LFS and then Gentoo. I never found them definitive for me.</p>
<p>I used Slackware by compiling sources most of all, then i didn&rsquo;t see any reason to continue using it.</p>
<p>The LFS came since my new PC as a test, and as long I could maintain it I had no problems and had fun with it.</p>
<p>I then installed Gentoo when i got my first DSL. But the updates are slow for lack of testing, I&rsquo;m on an amd64. I tried to contribute someway but for the time I&rsquo;ve been using it I never seen a open and innovative development (not in the sense that it wasn&rsquo;t friendly). And also, I&rsquo;ve seen many developers leaving the project.</p>
<p>In other words, I &ldquo;almost&rdquo; used always source-based distribution. All the time I tried other binary-based distribution also to change my way of linux-life, like OpenSUSE, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Foresight, and so on but no one satisfied me.</p>
<p>Then i wanted to try Debian, hoping it was different than Ubuntu. And in fact it is!<br>
What I like of Debian is it&rsquo;s very high QA, how new users deal with bugs, how stable it is, how the BTS work, how the packaging works (eventough there are lots of useful tools I still don&rsquo;t know), the rapid updates, the security.</p>
<p>The thing I dislike from other distribution is that they release new stable versions but that are not so stable at first. For example i had troubles with the package manager with both Ubuntu and Foresight. Boot problems with Ubuntu, several crashes with Foresight, and so on.</p>
<p>But, I don&rsquo;t want to say Debian is now my preferred distro (I&rsquo;m still afraid of binaries), but this is the good way and hopefully the last choice. Go Debian!</p>
